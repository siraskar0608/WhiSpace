You are a creative web developer. Create a fully interactive, educational website about the solar system using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Incorporate the following features:

Realistic orbital animations showing planets revolving around the sun using CSS or JavaScript animations.

Clickable planets that open detailed info panels or modals with scientific facts, distances, and characteristics.

Quiz section with instant feedback and scoring â€” include 3 to 5 space-related questions.

Parallax scrolling effect that adds depth as users scroll between solar system sections (e.g., Sun â†’ Mercury â†’ Venus, etc.).

3D elements using Three.js to render a dynamic model of the solar system or rotating planets. Provide integration steps and clearly separate the Three.js code from the rest.

Apply a hybrid design style:

Scientific realism (accurate planetary scale/spacing where feasible)

Futuristic/minimalist UI (dark mode, clean font, glowing orbits)

Colorful and engaging visuals to appeal to younger learners and casual visitors

Make the entire experience responsive, mobile-friendly, and smoothly animated.

Include brief documentation comments within the code to explain key sections like orbit logic, quiz logic, and 3D rendering.

âœ… Do not use React or any heavy framework.
âœ… Use external libraries only if necessary, and clearly mention how to include them via CDN or setup instructions.
âœ… Avoid any external API integration. Keep all logic self-contained.

ðŸŽ¯ End goal: A portfolio-worthy, educational solar system website that is both visually impressive and pedagogically valuable.
